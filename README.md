==============

The idea is to write a text based game on some subject in Spectrum basic for the 48k Spectrum. This is the very definition of a pointless but captivating project. The project started from a throwaway comment on the SoftwareSaved Twitter account: https://twitter.com/SoftwareSaved/statuses/451372973308776448. 

Don't know Spectrum basic? Maybe you weren't alive in the 80s? Fortunately the manual have been digitised: http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/
